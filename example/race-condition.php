			<h1>squeezr | cookie race condition test</h1>
			<p>This page contains an inline piece of JavaScript in it's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section, which sets a cookie with a random value on each reload. This time the value is:</p>
			<pre><?php echo $random; ?></pre>
			<p>Furthermore, there's one CSS and one image embedded into this page. Both of them <em>should</em> receive the cookie value. However, not any browser does set the cookie fast enough, or at least not in a reliable fashion, which is a known problem ("race condition"; you might read <a href="http://blog.cloudfour.com/responsive-imgs/" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="http://blog.yoav.ws/2011/09/Preloaders-cookies-and-race-conditions" target="_blank">here</a> for further information).</p>
			<p>These are the results for your current browser (I encourage you to try this also with other clients, and be sure to hit reload a few times in order to spot if it's consistent or not!):</p>
			<h3>CSS request</h3>
			<p class="css-check success">Congratulations! As for the CSS request, your browser did set the cookie fast enough!</p>
			<p class="css-check fail">Sorry, this was not fast enough! The CSS request didn't carry the correct cookie value ...</p>
			<h3>Image request</h3>
			<p><img src="img/race-condition-image.php?random=<?php echo $random; ?>"/></p>
